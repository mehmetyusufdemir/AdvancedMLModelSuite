# AdvancedMLModelSuite

The aim of this project is to develop Machine Learning/Deep Learning Based Intrusion Detection Systems and create a framework for these systems, and to see how deep learning algorithms are used in cyber security.
Within the scope of the project, analysis of intrusion detection systems through data sets, necessary pre-processing and feature selection processes on the system, identification and resolution of deficiencies in the system, and performance analysis of the system and the models used were carried out.
Thanks to this study, an educational framework has emerged and a new perspective has been gained on machine learning-based intrusion detection systems.
